The idea behind this project is to exercise some of the OOP  techniques learned throughtout this course.


### Here you will find:
* **data_pipeline_mini_project.py:**
This is the main file, the one you should run. It has the main pipeline commands

* **sqlManager.py:**
It contains all functions, used by 'data_pipeline_mini_project.py', to interact with the raw data (CSV) and the database

### How to run the program:
You can run using command line. Make sure that:
- You are in the correct directory to run the pipeline
- You create and set up correctly the config file with the database credentials
- Adjust the directory path to input the raw CSV file
